- within typescript environment the development makes much more sense to a newbie like me :)

## To run the project first ensure you got node.js installed and also typescript

1) Clone the repo with: git clone <link>

2) Install dependencies: npm install

3) Run the commands bellow to launch the development server on your localhost address (defaults to port 5500)

## CLI Available Scripts
